On day 6 we are going to look further into the concepts of standard deviation and Variance

So variance is a measure of how spread out a set of data is from its mean.

We can also check the mean using the np.mean function

on the other hand  standard deviation is the square root of the variance, representing the average deviation of data points from the mean
