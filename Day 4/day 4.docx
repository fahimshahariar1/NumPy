On Day 4 we are going to learn how we can manipulate arrays in Numpy

the first thing that we are going to see today is how we can use Arithmetic Operations on arrays

We can simply use the + between two arrays and it will add two arrays and their corresponding position values and give you the result

Similarly, we can use every other function, such as subtraction, multiplications, etc.

these are simple operations. what if we want to do the same with more complex arrays like in the previous lectures we tried to work with a3 array.

so if you try to multiply a2 * a3 you'd see it will throw an error because the shapes of the arrays doesn't match.
So, how can we resolve this?
