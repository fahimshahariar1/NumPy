We have completed learning about Pandas or the basics of Pandas that we can use directly in our work.

Now we will learn about NumPy which is another important tool for learning Data Science and Machine Learning

NumPy is a library for Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection Of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these
arrays.

So let's start.

The first thing that we are going to learn in NumPy is data types and Attributes

Numpy has one datatype and that is ndarray. Whatever you are going to see and work with is going to be ndarray 

To create an array we can call the np.array() function and inside the function, we can pass different values to create different types of arrays.

Check out the notebook for more details

Next, we would see the shape and dimensions of the arrays.
We can use the .shape function to know about the shape of the arrays and the .ndim function to know about the dimensions of the array 
Check out the notebook for more details

We can also check the .type and .size of the arrays.

Now let's do something interesting. Let's create a Pandas dataframe from the NumPy array
and to do that we would need to first import pandas as we did before and then use the pd.Dataframe() command and pass in the array 
and you would see it created a beautiful dataframe from the NumPy array.

This shows that if you have a data frame, you can use a Numpy action on it because Pandas is built on NumPy.

Okay so that's it for the first lecture we will see more in the next day
