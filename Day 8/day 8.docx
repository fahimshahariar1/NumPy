Today we will see that we know about reshaping and transposing but where will we use it?
So one of the places where we can use this is the Dot Product
That is what we are going to look at today

So we already know how to do basic mathematic operations on a matrix.
Then what is Dot product?
Dot Product is a basic linear algebra computation used in deep learning models to complete operations with larger amounts of data more efficiently.

Now if we try to do the dot operation on the arrays np.dot(mat1, mat2)
You'd see we are getting an error showing "shapes (5,3) and (5,3) not aligned: 3 (dim 1) != 5 (dim 0)"

Although both the arrays are of the same shape still can't use dot on them

To use the Dot operation we need to transpose one of the shapes so that the inner value matches the two matrices
For example, in the notebook,k we used a matrix of shapes (5, 3) (5, 3)
Now to use the Dot operator one of the shapes has to change and make it either (3, 5) (5, 3) or (5, 3) (3, 5) so that the inner 2 values match and based on that the output would be in the shape of at the right most value

Let's check the notebook

So that's how we are going to use the Dot operator.
