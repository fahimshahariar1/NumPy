Today we will see that we know about reshaping and transposing but where will we use it?
So one of the places where we can use this is the Dot Product
That is what we are going to look at today

So we already know how to do basic mathematic operations on a matrix.
Then what is Dot product?
Dot Product is a basic linear algebra computation used in deep learning models to complete operations with larger amounts of data more efficiently.
