We have seen how we can create arrays in different ways but now we will see how we can view the arrays and matrices

Before that let's see something easier. 
What if we want to find unique numbers from an array? To do that we can use the unique() function
np.unique(sample_array) This will return all the unique numbers in that array

All the arrays that we have created before if we want to see the value at the first index we can use a1[0]. this will return the values but depending on the array itself.
if you run the code you will see this is returning all the values at index 0 based on their dimensions
for a1 array as its 1 dimension and a vector so it returns just the first number
but for a2 and a3 as they are multi-dimensional matrices they return the array value at the index

we can also slice the matrices like Python list a1[:2]
as a3 array is multi-dimensional we need to slice it in a different way
as a2 is 2 3 3 dimensional that's why you need to put values for each parameter to slice it
