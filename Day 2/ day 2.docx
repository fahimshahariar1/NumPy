On day 2 of learning NumPy we will learn about how we can create arrays.
you might say that we have already done it in the previou section.
yes, you are right but in the last section we created arrays by passing the values of the arrays inside the fucntion.

What if we don't want to do that. what if we want to create arrays that would have default values inserted to itself.
That's what we are going to learn today
