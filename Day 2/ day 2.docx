On day 2 of learning NumPy we will learn about how we can create arrays.
you might say that we have already done it in the previous section.
yes, you are right but in the last section,n we created arrays by passing the values of the arrays inside the function.

What if we don't want to do that? What if we want to create arrays that have default values inserted into them?
That's what we are going to learn today 

If we want to learn about a particular function we can press shift+tab inside the brackets of the function then it would give us information about that function

The function that we will try today is np.ones() this would make an array of the given shape filled with 1s. We can do similar with 0s

We can also create an array using np.arange() function where we need to put a start, end, and step values and it would create an array based on that

Now, what if we want to create an array completely random then we can use the np.random.randint() where you need to put low, high, and size

if in doubt check the notebook and press shift+tab to know more about that function

We can create random arrays in other ways as well using
np.random.random(()) just put the shape inside it and it will generate such

we can also use np.random.rand() this two works kind of same

That's all for today
check out the notebook and try for yourself
