So Today we will look into a real life example of where we might be using the Dot Product
For that, we will work on a Nut Job example. This will show how much of jars we have sold for a particular day and what our profit

To do that we will first create an array which would be jars sold
and a data frame for weekly sales
sales_amount = np.random.randint(20, size=(5,3))
weekly_sales = pd.DataFrame(sales_amount, 
                            index=["Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thurs", "Fri"],
                           columns = ["Almond Butter", "Peanut Butter", "Cashew Butter"])

Yes you might say this is tedious and definitely you can just import the CSV and work on it but creating a dataframe from scratch will give you a more in-depth knowledge
