on day 5 we continued looking into Manipulating and comparing Numpy arrays further

The first thing that we are going to look into today is Aggregation.

Aggregation means performing the same operation on a number of things
. You might have seen different functions to perform the same operations in Numpy. The question is why are there multiple methods for doing the same operations?
and what you should use at what time?
The answer is easy. If you are using Python datatypes such as list or tupples then use Python's methods
and if you are using NumPy arrays then use Numpy's methods
