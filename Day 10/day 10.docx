Today we will look into the basic comparison operators
  these are nothing but the basic operations that we do (eg, ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
  We can use them to compare between arrays and this will return us boolean values

That is comparison operators of arrays

The next thing that we are going to look into today is sorting arrays

Sorting arrays returns us a sorted version of a particular array
for example 
array([[2, 9, 0, 7, 8],
       [0, 3, 0, 1, 3],
       [9, 7, 4, 7, 9]])

this is the original array. but if we use the np.sort function this will return as 

array([[0, 2, 7, 8, 9],
       [0, 0, 1, 3, 3],
       [4, 7, 7, 9, 9]]) as sorted

We can also use the np.argsort function and this returns the indexes of the values of the array
