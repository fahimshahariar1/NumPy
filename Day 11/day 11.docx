what if you want to turn an image into an array?

So this is what we are going to look into today

to import an image into your notebook you need to use this command <img src = "Resources/panda.jpg"/>
and remember this has to be a markdown cell, not a code. after running you will see the picture

Then we will need to use matplotlib to change the image. we will use the imread function which will Read an image from a file into an array.

Then we just need to pass the file path and you will see this have converted the image to an array
