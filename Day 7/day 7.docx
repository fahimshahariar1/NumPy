On day 7 we are going to learn about Reshaping and Transposing the array

remember how we wanted to change the shape of an array previously?
Well that is what we are going to be looking at today

as we can see from our example that a2 array and a3 array are of different shapes that's why they are not compatible with each other for any operation

Now if we want to do any operation on them we will need to change the shape of one of them 

To change the shape of an array we can use the .rehsape() function.
When we try the a2.reshape(), it will ask us to provide a shape that we want to change the shape into

as we know the shape of the a3 array is (2,3,3) so if we pass (2,3,1) as a shape inside the reshape function it will convert the a2 array shape
Now if we multiply it will work

The next thing that we are going to look into is Transpose

Transpose basically flips the arrays the rows will become columns and columns will turn into rows
